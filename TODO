- Implement signals.
- Implement arbitrary messages.
- Ignore SIGPIPE on socket level.
- Add new assertions to the test suite: lower-than, lower-or-equal-to,
  greater-than and greater-or-equal-to.
- Proper bbus_hmap_dump().
- bbus_obj_extrbytes() shouldn't probably take the size argument and instead
  only rely on the array size taken from the object buffer.
- Some other way to store and read byte arrays from object with obj_build and
  obj_parse functions.
- Functions taking struct bbus_msg as argument should not require msgsize -
  they have it already in hdr->psize.
