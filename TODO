- Implement signals.
- Implement arbitrary messages.
- Remove the bbus_connectp-like functions and instead add a global, thread-safe
  path string accessible and changeable with dedicated functions.
- Add a new library function and data structures for argument parsing to avoid
  code duplication in every binary.
- Add thread-specific error values.
- Ignore SIGPIPE on socket level.
- Hashmaps should use bbus_list functions instead of insque and remque.
- Make bbus_hdr_setpsize accept a size_t and set psize to UINT16_MAX if
  it's greater than 65535.
- Add new assertions to the test suite: lower-than, lower-or-equal-to,
  greater-than and greater-or-equal-to.
- Proper bbus_hmap_dump().
- bbus_obj_extrbytes() shouldn't probably take the size argument and instead
  only rely on the array size taken from the object buffer.
